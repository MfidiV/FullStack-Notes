# `What is Software Prototyping`

Software prototyping is a preliminary version of a software application:
- with limited functionality, 
- used to assess developer proposals and understand user-specific requirements,
-  despite not always containing the exact logic used in the actual application.

# `Prototyping in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)`
## `Basic Requirement Identification`

This step involves understanding the fundamental product requirements, especially focusing on user interface aspects. Detailed internal design and external factors like performance and security are not prioritized at this stage.

## `Developing the Initial Prototype`

The initial prototype is created in this stage, showcasing basic requirements and providing user interfaces. The internal workings of the software may not match the prototype exactly, using workarounds to simulate the desired look and feel.

## `Review of the Prototype`

The prototype is presented to customers and stakeholders for feedback. Feedback is collected systematically and utilized for further product enhancements.

## `Revise and Enhance the Prototype`

Feedback and review comments are discussed, and negotiations with customers may occur based on factors like time, budget constraints, and technical feasibility. Accepted changes are incorporated into a new prototype, and the cycle repeats until customer expectations are met.

## `Types of Prototypes`

- **Horizontal Prototype:** Displays the user interface for the entire system without focusing on internal functions.
- **Vertical Prototype:** Elaborates on a specific function or subsystem, providing detailed insights into its functioning.

## `Software Prototyping Types`

1. **`Throwaway/Rapid Prototyping:`** Minimal effort and analysis, prototype is discarded once requirements are understood.
2. **`Evolutionary Prototyping:`** Actual functional prototypes with minimal functionality are built progressively.
3. **`Incremental Prototyping:`** Multiple functional prototypes of various subsystems are built and integrated to form a complete system.
4. **`Extreme Prototyping:`** Used in web development, involves sequential phases to develop a fully functional UI with little concern for actual services.

## `Application of Software Prototyping`

Prototyping is most useful in systems with high user interactions, such as online systems. Systems heavily focused on data processing with minimal user interface may not benefit significantly from prototyping.

## `Best Practices of Prototyping`

- Use prototyping when requirements are unclear.
- Perform planned and controlled prototyping.
- Conduct regular meetings to avoid delays.
- Be aware of prototyping issues and pitfalls.
- Approve a prototype early before moving to the next step.
- Don't hesitate to change earlier decisions based on new ideas.
- Select an appropriate step size for each version.
- Implement important features early to ensure a worthwhile system.

## `Advantages of the Prototyping Model`

- Active user involvement detects errors early.
- Identifies missing functionality, reducing the risk of failure.
- Enhances communication among team members.
- Increases customer satisfaction by providing an early look and feel.
- Reduces chances of software rejection.
- Facilitates quicker user feedback for better solutions.
- Allows clients to compare software code with specifications.
- Helps find missing functionality and complex functions.
- Encourages innovation and flexible designing.
- Easy to understand as a straightforward model.
- No need for specialized experts to build the model.
- Serves as a basis for deriving a system specification.
- Aids in gaining a better understanding of customer needs.

## `Disadvantages of the Prototyping Model`

- Prototyping is a slow and time-consuming process.
- The cost of developing a prototype is considered a total waste.
- May encourage excessive change requests.
- Customers may not be willing to participate in lengthy iteration cycles.
- Too many variations in software requirements during each prototype evaluation.
- Poor documentation due to changing customer requirements.
- Difficult for developers to accommodate all changes demanded by clients.
- Customers may lose interest in the final product if unhappy with the initial prototype.
- Developers may build sub-standard solutions in an attempt to build prototypes quickly.
