# Error output redirection and program termination

Error output redirection and program termination are concepts related to handling errors in a program, particularly in the context of how errors are reported and how the program responds to exceptional conditions.

The sys module also has attributes for **stdin, stdout, and stderr.** The latter is useful for emitting warnings and error messages to make them visible even when stdout has been redirected:

# 1. Error Output Redirection:
Error output redirection involves directing error messages (stderr) to a file or another location instead of the default output (stdout). In Unix-like systems, you can use the shell to redirect standard error by using the 2> notation.

For example:
```python 
python my_program.py 2> error_log.txt
```
In this case, any error messages produced by my_program.py would be written to the error_log.txt file instead of being displayed on the console.

# 2. Program Termination:
Program termination refers to the process of ending the execution of a program. This can occur under normal circumstances when the program has completed its tasks, or it can happen abruptly due to errors or exceptional conditions.

+ **Normal Termination:**

+ + The program completes its execution, and the operating system returns control to the user or calling process.
+ **Abnormal Termination:**

+ + This occurs when an error or exceptional condition is encountered that the program cannot handle. The program might terminate with an error code, crash, or raise an exception.


In Python, you can explicitly terminate a program using the **sys.exit()** function from the **sys** module. For example:

```python
import sys

def some_function():
    # ...
    if error_condition:
        print("Error: Something went wrong.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Terminate the program with an error code

# Rest of the program

```
Here, if error_condition is true, the program terminates with an exit code of 1. This exit code can be checked by the calling process or used for error handling.
