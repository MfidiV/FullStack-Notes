## logging
Logging is a **built-in module** that provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. The logging module supports various log levels, allowing you to categorize and filter log messages based on their importance.

```python
import logging

# Custom filter class for prioritizing log messages
class PriorityFilter(logging.Filter):
    def __init__(self, priority):
        self.priority = priority

    def filter(self, record):
        # Allow log records with the specified priority level and higher
        return record.levelno >= getattr(logging, self.priority)

# Configure the logging system
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
)

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Create filters for different priority levels
debug_filter = PriorityFilter('DEBUG')
info_filter = PriorityFilter('INFO')
warning_filter = PriorityFilter('WARNING')
error_filter = PriorityFilter('ERROR')
critical_filter = PriorityFilter('CRITICAL')

# Create handlers for different priority levels
debug_handler = logging.FileHandler('debug.log')
info_handler = logging.FileHandler('info.log')
warning_handler = logging.FileHandler('warning.log')
error_handler = logging.FileHandler('error.log')
critical_handler = logging.FileHandler('critical.log')

# Attach filters to handlers
debug_handler.addFilter(debug_filter)
info_handler.addFilter(info_filter)
warning_handler.addFilter(warning_filter)
error_handler.addFilter(error_filter)
critical_handler.addFilter(critical_filter)

# Attach handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(debug_handler)
logger.addHandler(info_handler)
logger.addHandler(warning_handler)
logger.addHandler(error_handler)
logger.addHandler(critical_handler)

# Example usage
def main():
    logger.debug("This is a debug message")
    logger.info("This is an info message")
    logger.warning("This is a warning message")
    logger.error("This is an error message")
    logger.critical("This is a critical message")

if __name__ ==
main()
```

## Creating and managing virtual environments in Python using venv.

 Indeed, virtual environments are a crucial tool for isolating dependencies and ensuring that different projects can have their own independent set of packages.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.

3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment. Replace myenv with the name you want for your virtual environment.

```python
python -m venv myenv
```

If you are using Python 3.3 or newer, you can use the python command. For Python 3.6 and newer, venv is included by default.

## Why Use Virtual Environments?
+ **Isolation:** Virtual environments keep your project's dependencies separate from the global Python environment and other project environments.

+ **Version Control:** You can include the requirements.txt file in your project, listing all the dependencies. This makes it easy for others to recreate the same environment.

+ **Cleaner Projects:** Virtual environments help maintain a clean and organized project structure, reducing conflicts between different project dependencies.

Remember, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment for each new project to avoid conflicts and ensure a consistent development environment.
