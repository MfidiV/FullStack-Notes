# Operators in Python

In Python programming, operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. They are standard symbols used for logical and arithmetic operations.

## Types of Operators in Python

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Identity Operators and Membership Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators in Python are used for basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division (float)
- `//`: Division (floor)
- `%`: Modulus
- `**`: Power



## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values in Python.

- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements in Python.

- `and`: Logical AND
- `or`: Logical OR
- `not`: Logical NOT

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform bit-level operations on binary numbers.

- `&`: Bitwise AND
- `|`: Bitwise OR
- `~`: Bitwise NOT
- `^`: Bitwise XOR
- `>>`: Bitwise right shift
- `<<`: Bitwise left shift

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables in Python.

- `=`: Assign
- `+=`: Add and assign
- `-=`: Subtract and assign
- `*=`: Multiply and assign
- `/=`: Divide and assign
- `%=`: Modulus and assign
- `//=`: Divide (floor) and assign
- `**=`: Exponent and assign
- `&=`: Bitwise AND and assign
- `|=`: Bitwise OR and assign
- `^=`: Bitwise XOR and assign
- `>>=`: Bitwise right shift and assign
- `<<=`: Bitwise left shift and assign

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to check if two variables are located at the same memory address.

- `is`: True if the operands are identical
- `is not`: True if the operands are not identical

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to check if a value or variable is in a sequence.

- `in`: True if the value is found in the sequence
- `not in`: True if the value is not found in the sequence

## Precedence and Associativity

Operator precedence and associativity determine the order of operations in complex expressions.

### Operator Precedence

- Parentheses (Highest precedence)
- Exponentiation
- Multiplication and Division (Same precedence)
- Addition and Subtraction (Same precedence)

### Operator Associativity

- Left to Right (e.g., addition, subtraction)
- Right to Left (e.g., exponentiation)
