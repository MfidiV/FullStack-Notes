## Lambda Expressions in Python

Lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but without a name. They're commonly referred to as anonymous functions.

Lambda functions are efficient whenever you want to create a function that will only contain simple expressions â€“ that is, expressions that are usually a single line of a statement. They're also useful when you want to use the function once.

### Syntax of a Lambda Expression

A lambda expression has the following syntax:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- **Arguments**: Arguments are the input parameters of the lambda function.
- **Expression**: An expression is a single expression that gets evaluated and returned.

### Use Cases

Lambda expressions are often used in the following scenarios:

**Filtering a list:**
```Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

```
**Mapping a List:**
```Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))

```
**Sorting a Tuples**
```python
people = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25), ("Eve", 35)]
people.sort(key=lambda person: person[1])

```

- **Anonymous Functions**: Lambda expressions are used when you need to pass a small function as an argument to another function.

### Best Practices

Lambda expressions are concise and convenient but should be used judiciously. For more complex or reusable functions, it's better to define a named function using the `def` keyword.

The frequency of using lambda expressions depends on the specific problem and coding style, but they can make code more concise and readable when used appropriately.
