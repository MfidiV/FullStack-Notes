# Control Flow in Python

A program's control flow is the order in which the program's code executes. Python uses three main types of control structures to manage the control flow.

## Sequential (Default Mode)
- By default, Python executes code sequentially, from top to bottom.
- Statements are executed in the order they appear in the code.

## Selection
- Selection control structures are used for making decisions and branching the program's flow.
- The `if-elif-else` statement allows code execution based on conditions.
- Example:
  ```python
  if condition:
      # Code to execute if the condition is true
  elif another_condition:
      # Code to execute if another_condition is true
  else:
      # Code to execute if no conditions are met
