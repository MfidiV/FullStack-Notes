## Python Data Types and Naming Conventions

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:


## Data Types in Python

Python supports several data types to work with different kinds of values. Here are some of the key data types:

### Integers (int)

- Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.
- Example: 
  - `42` - A positive integer.
  - `-3` - A negative integer.
  - `0` - Zero.

### Booleans (bool)

- Booleans represent two values: `True` or `False`.
- They are often used for conditional statements and comparisons.
- Example:
  - `True` - Denotes a true condition.
  - `False` - Denotes a false condition.

### Floating-Point Numbers (float)

- Floating-point numbers represent real numbers with decimal points.
- Example:
  - `3.14` - A positive floating-point number.
  - `0.001` - A small positive floating-point number.
  - `-2.5` - A negative floating-point number.

### Complex Numbers (complex)

- Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part.
- They are written with a `j` or `J` to denote the imaginary part.
- Example:
  - `3 + 2j` - A complex number with a real part of 3 and an imaginary part of 2.
  - `-1 - 0.5J` - A complex number with a real part of -1 and an imaginary part of -0.5.

### Strings (str)

- Strings are used to represent text and are enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' 'or """ ') quotes.
- Example:
  - `"Hello, World!"` - A string with double quotes.
  - `'Python is fun'` - A string with single quotes.

These data types are fundamental in Python and allow you to work with a wide range of values and perform various operations in your code.
