# React Native: Build Native Apps for Android, iOS, and More

React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Key Features:**

- **Written in JavaScript—rendered with native code:** React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.

- **Many platforms, one React:** Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain multiple platforms and share a common technology—React.

- **Seamless Cross-Platform:** React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.

**Usage:**

Use React Native in your existing Android and iOS projects or create a whole new app from scratch.
