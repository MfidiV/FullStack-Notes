# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server, making it a popular choice for building web applications, server-side APIs, and various networking applications.

## Key Features

- **JavaScript on the Server:** Node.js enables JavaScript to be used on the server side, making it easier to create full-stack applications.

- **Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it highly scalable.

- **V8 JavaScript Engine:** Built on Google's V8 engine, known for its speed and performance.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Comes with NPM, a powerful package manager for dependency management.

- **Single-Threaded:** Operates in a single-threaded event loop but can offload tasks for multi-core processors.

- **Modules and CommonJS:** Organizes code into reusable modules using the CommonJS module system.

- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on various operating systems.

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Supports asynchronous operations using callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

- **Community and Ecosystem:** Has a vibrant community and extensive library ecosystem.

- **Web Development:** Used for building web applications and APIs, often paired with front-end frameworks.

- **Real-Time Applications:** Suitable for real-time applications like chat and gaming.

- **Command-Line Tools:** Can be used for building command-line tools and scripts.

- **Security:** Requires attention to security best practices.
