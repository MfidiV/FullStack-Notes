## Install Dependencies
In Node.js, dependencies are external modules or libraries that your application requires to function properly. These modules or libraries are typically stored in the node_modules directory of your project and are managed by a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager).
Here's how you typically work with dependencies in Node.js:


1. Installing Dependencies:
Use npm to install dependencies for your project. For example, to install the Express web framework, you would run.

        npm install express

2. <b>Package Json</b>

When you install a package using npm, it creates or updates a package.json file in your project directory. This file contains metadata about your project and a list of dependencies. For example:


```javascrips
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```
The dependencies section lists the installed packages and their versions.

3. Importing Dependencies:
To use a dependency in your code, you need to import it. For example, to use Express, you would import it like this:
```javascript
const express = require('express');

```
4. Using Dependencies:
Once you've imported a dependency, you can use its features and functions in your code. For example, with Express, you can define routes and handle requests.

5. Updating Dependencies:
Over time, new versions of packages may be released. You can update your project's dependencies to the latest versions using:
```javascript
npm update
```

This will update your package.json with the latest versions within the specified version constraints and install the updated packages.

Dependencies help you manage and organize your code. They allow you to leverage existing code and functionality, making development more efficient and less error-prone. Additionally, package managers like npm simplify the process of installing, updating, and managing dependencies in Node.js projects.
